---- Basic interaction with the GPSDevice.jar --------

1. Have the car drive somewhere on the GPSDevice.jar.
	
1.1. The car is blue, it leaves a "slug trail" that is dark orange.
	
2. Select an end node in the displayPanel by double clicking
a pink dot point (set start should be disabled).
	
3. An light orange path in displayPanel should automatically 
show up that maps car to endNode.

receiving "satellite events".
		
4. If we want to stop receiving "satellite events", go
to Navigate > Disable Drive Mode.
		
5. Bottom Left Panel (GPSInfo Panel) shows some updates.
Map have to drag split pane over to see more.
